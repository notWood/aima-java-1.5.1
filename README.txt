= Final Thoughts =

If you need any help with the java code, do write to me at ctjoreilly@gmail.com.

I am happy to receive any mails/bug reports and generally respond within a day, 
unless I am traveling. The only mails I do NOT respond to are those asking me 
to do your homework! Don't even try ! :-) 

Bug Reports are greatly appreciated! 

When you send in a bug report please include:
 # what you did to see the bug
 # what you expected to see
 # what you actually saw.

Doing so gets you added to the "Bug Report - Acknowledgments" list :-), Happy Hacking!
